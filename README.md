### Implemented Emotion Detection Classifier

* Performed feature engineering using histogram of oriented gradient using scikit-learn

* Trained several models to classify the “neutral” and “happy” facial expressions presented in
a SMILE dataset using decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression – TensorFlow
and OpenCV

* Performed a 10-fold cross -validation to evaluate the performance of the tool
